I have made some concept XML for the app. I am new to XML and I am sure there will be lots of
improvements to the UI.

I have kept things simple and used colors that I have seen on other Android apps. I took the R_blue
and android_green colors directly from the logos of R and Android.

Currently, these are the steps of Randroid:

1. settings.xml
- CHOOSE DRIVE goes nowhere yet, but should select the user's drive to be used for the download.
- CHOOSE DOWNLOAD DIRECTORY goes nowhere yet, but should go to a directory on the Android phone.
- CHOOSE DOWNLOAD LIMIT should go to download_limit.xml

2. choose_mode.xml
- AUTOMATIC MODE should go to choose_output.xml.
- MANUAL MODE goes nowhere yet, but should go to the user's drive for manual file selection, and
  then it should go to choose_output.xml.

3. choose_output.xml
- JPG does not do anything yet, bus should select JPG format as the conversion format.
- PNG does not do anything yet, but should select PNG format as the conversion format.

4. choose_quality.xml
- HIGH QUALITY does not do anything yet, but should use the lowest compression level.
- MEDIUM QUALITY does not do anything yet, but should use the medium compression level.
- LOW QUALITY does not do anything yet, but should use the lowest compression level.

5. download_limit.xml
- The "slider" is not actually a slider. It's just an image with a button on it. When this is
  turned into a slider, it should limit the size of the destination directory to  prevent the
  user from filling their entire memory card with images.
- UNLIMITED does not do anything yet, but should eventually allow for limitless downloading.
  The user's hardware will be the only limitation. This will probably require catching and
  throwing an error.

6. downloading.xml
- This progress bar is not yet implemented. It should represent how many of the files have been
  converted and downloaded.
- The large "percent completed ???%" text is optional. Alternatively, we could incorporate it into
  the progress bar itself.

final notes and comments:

This is a very rough draft with no Java implementation yet. I will get that done tomorrow.
